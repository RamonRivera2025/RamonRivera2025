### 🎓 Learning → 💼 Applying → 🚀 Growing  

I’m passionate about taking the skills I've learned in school and applying them in real-world settings.  
In my current role, I’ve built experience in data entry, back office operations, and reporting, while incorporating tools like Excel & SQL to manage and analyze information.  At the same time, I’m continuing to build and expand my skill set.  I am sharpening my technical knowledge, improving workflows, and preparing for future opportunities in a remote data entry role and/or a remote business analytics role.  

### 🌱 Always Learning  
- 📊 Strengthening my data visualization with Power BI & Tableau 
- 🗄️ Practicing SQL for database management and queries  
- 📑 Improving automation and reporting in Excel
- 🦅 Developing a sharp eye for detail, accuracy, and efficiency  

### 🌟 Fun Facts  
- I spend my weekends with wrenches and my weekdays with Excel—turning both engines and data into well-oiled machines 🔧📊
- I once built a back office system from scratch with no prior experience—learning by doing is my superpower
- On Sundays, you can usually find me watching the Philadelphia Eagles 🦅
- You can usually catch me with my headphones on, listening to world news and staying curious 🎧🌍


### 🤝 Open to Opportunities  
I’m available for outsourced projects where I can apply my data entry, reporting, and analytics skills to help businesses save time and operate more efficiently.
