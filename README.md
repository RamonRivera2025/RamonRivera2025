## Hi there üëã
Detail-oriented professional with experience in data entry, back office operations, and client/vendor management. Skilled in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, I specialize in transforming raw data into accurate reports and actionable insights.  I am seeking remote opportunities where I can apply my expertise to improve business efficiency.

### üåü Fun Facts  
- I once built a back office system from scratch with no prior experience‚Äîlearning by doing is my superpower.  
- I love organizing messy data into something clear and useful (bonus points if I can color-code it).  
- Coffee and spreadsheets are my perfect pair.  

### ü§ù Open to Opportunities  
I‚Äôm interested in collaborating on **outsourcing projects** where I can apply my data entry, reporting, and analytics skills to help businesses save time and operate more efficiently.
